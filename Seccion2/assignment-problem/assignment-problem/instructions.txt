Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).                            x
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!
docker build .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.                              x
docker run -it df943eedd00c
docker run -p 3000:3000 30729232ebfc

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.
>docker run -p 3000:3000 --name nodeApp -d --rm 30729232ebfc
>docker run -it --rm --name pyApp df943eedd00

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.
>docker run -p 3000:3000 --name nodeApp -d --rm 30729232ebfc
>docker run -it --rm --name pyApp df943eedd00c


5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.                        xx
docker build -t assignment:python .
docker build -t assignment:node .


6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers             xx
are removed automatically when stopped.
